## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with summary and detail HTML elements. I had learned them briefly before but moved on to other
elements. I have a greater appreciation for these elements and their applications. I also was able to work with multiple
background images in a container again with this project.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to work with multiple background images and also working with breakpoints. I had also used
transitions with this project, I would like to continue learning how to work with transitions and custom animiations.
